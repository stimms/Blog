My name is Simon Timms, I work as a freelance software developer with an interest in distributed systems, CQRS, cloud computing and ice cream. Ice cream most of all. I don' t know if you've tried pumpkin pie ice cream but you really should.

In the past I've worked on GPS systems, been a build master, developed websites, written production accounting software and painted fire hydrants. I've got experience in building everything from serial port drivers for android to 

I've been Microsoft MVP in ASP.net since April of 2014. I've also written two books with Packt publishing

I've also written a self-published book with [David Paquette](http://www.davepaquette.com/) through [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/evolvinglegacyaspnetapplications). Not learning my lesson from that David and I teamed up with [James Chambers](http://jameschambers.com/) to write [ASP.NET Core Application Development: Building an application in four sprints](https://www.amazon.com/ASP-NET-Core-Application-Development-application/dp/1509304061)

I also blog over on [Western Devs](https://westerndevs.com/) a loose blogging coalition of people far smarter than me. 

Recently I've started a special blogging project as I attempt to learn about Artificial Intelligence. That's hosted at [https://aiadventure.simontimms.com](https://aiadventure.simontimms.com). 

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/stimms) is probably the best way to get a hold of me.
