Today I'm doing a talk at the Calgary .net group about HTML 5 data visualizations. If you're interested in learning a bit about some of the cool, interactive graphics which HTML 5 enables on the browser then I encourage you to come out. You will go away knowing how to build a simple bar chart in a handful of JavaScript and you may even learn something about [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org).

The event starts at high noon in downtown Calgary, 800 6th Ave SW (+15 Level across from Spice Cafe):

Bring your lunch and come out, you'll be done in plenty of time to make it back to work for 1. The slides and demos will be posted here once my presentation has started.
