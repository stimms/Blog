My name is Simon Timms, I work as a freelance software developer with an interest in distributed systems, CQRS, cloud computing and ice cream. Ice cream most of all. I don' t know if you've tried pumpkin pie ice cream but you really should.

In the past I've worked on GPS systems, been a build master, developed websites, written production accounting software and painted fire hydrants. At the moment I work for a directional drilling company on a bunch of different cool stuff.

I've been Microsoft MVP in ASP.net since April of 2014. I've also written two books with Packt publishing

I'm currently working on my third book with [David Paquette](http://www.davepaquette.com/)which we're self-publishing through [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/evolvinglegacyaspnetapplications). We're offering early access to it as we write it "â€œ it's cheaper if you [buy it now](https://leanpub.com/evolvinglegacyaspnetapplications).
