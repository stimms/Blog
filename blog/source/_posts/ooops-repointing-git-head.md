I screwed up. I force pushed a branch but I forgot to tell git which branch to push so it clobbered another branch. 

```
C:\code\project [feature/feature27]> git push -f

 + 0baa5b8...e9a1c19 develop -> develop (forced update)  <--oops!
 + dbe6fce...5557ae7 feature/feature27 -> feature/feature27 (forced update)
```

Drat, since I hadn't updated develop in a few hours there were a bunch of changes in it that I just killed. Fortunately I know that git is really just a glorified linked list and that nothing is ever deleted. I just needed to update where the head pointer was pointing. I grabbed the SHA of the latest develop commit from the build server knowing that it was late at night and nobody else was likely to have snuck a commit into develop that the server missed. 

Then I just force updated my local develop and pushed it back up
```
git branch -f develop bbff5b810a19383fb11950a5d1e36676dd3ca85d  <-- sha from build server
git push
```

All was good again.
