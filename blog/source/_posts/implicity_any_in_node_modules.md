I like to set `noImplicitAny` in my TypeScript projects in the hopes it will catch just a few more bugs before they hit production. Problem we had recently was that not every library author agrees with me. In this case the aws-amplify project gave us this error. 

```
node_modules/aws-amplify/lib/Interactions/Interactions.d.ts
(19,44): Parameter 'err' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

Well that sucks, they should use `noImplicitAny`! From our perspective we can fix this by not applying our implicit any rules to library definition files. This can be done by adding 

```javascript
"skipLibCheck": true
```

To the `compilerOptions` in our `tsconfig.json` so that errors in the definition files there were ignored.
