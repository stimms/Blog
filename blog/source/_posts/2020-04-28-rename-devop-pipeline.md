Simple things should be simple. But they aren't always. In today's challenge all I wanted was to rename a build definition in Azure devops. I spent ages fumbling around the edit screen for the build definition trying to find how to rename it.

There is no way to do it from there. So I googled it and found a raft of great content on how to change the build number but nothing on how to change the build definition name. Eventually I found it. You need to go back up one level by clicking on the breadcrub from that edit screen.

Next you can rename by clicking on the `...` menu
