title: Is software free now?

I've been developing software for a good long time now and have put dozens of systems into production. What's more interesting is that I've created a ton of system which are no longer in use. Sometimes it is because the business was bought out by some other company. Some because the company went out of business (not my faut, I swear). And some just because the software was no longer needed.

It's apparent that software has a limited lifespan and with AI making writing software easier than ever. I still don't quite think it is easy enough for anyone to do but it is getting there. So what does that mean for the value of software?

There is a great article from Martin Alderson title [Has the cost of building software just dropped 90%?](https://martinalderson.com/posts/has-the-cost-of-software-just-dropped-90-percent/). In it he argues that [Jevons Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) suggests that more software will end up being written as the cost of writing it drops. Comapanies which would have never been able to affort a piece of custom software will all of a sudden be able to build that tooling and save time and money. Just looking at the myriad of spreadsheets that the average company uses to run their business it is clear that there is a lot of value to be had in automating those processes.

So I think the real change we're going to see in the short term is that even companies which are nervous about AI are not going to be as nervous about letting AI build software for them. At first it's just going to be random pieces of local tooling: building email workflows, automating customer outreach that sort of thing. But as the success of those things grows it seems to me like some of those smaller pieces of custom software will be replaced by bespoke software. 

For instance I use QuickBooks for my accounting. But really it is dramatic, and expensive, overkill for my needs. With a few hours work I think I could replace my QuickBooks with bespoke software that does exactly what I need and nothing more. And if the cost of building that software is low enough then why not? I'd love nothing more than to no longer have to pay $50/year to Intuit. 

I don't think anybody is going to replace SAP or Oracle with in-house software. Yet. But there is plenty of middle sized software that could be replaced. It should be interesting to see just how this plays out for these companies.
