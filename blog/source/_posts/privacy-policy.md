Visiting this site collects no information about you other than your geographic location. We use this to plot out your location on a map, because that's kind of cool to see.

When you comment on our site we collect your name and e-mail address. You name we show on the site and the e-mail address we retain. We'll never send you an e-mail or give you information to anybody, ever. Don't even worry about it.

If you're worried drop me a line
