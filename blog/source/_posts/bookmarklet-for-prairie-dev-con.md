Well here I am again at Prairie Dev Con and everybody has gone to bed early. Responsible speakers, or something. I went to figure out what sessions to attend but it is kind of tough to remember. So I built a bookmarklet to let me highlight sessions. Just copy and paste this

<script src='https://gist.github.com/stimms/5523182.js'></script>

into a new bookmark in your bookmark bar.Click on it when you're on the session page to let you highlight sessions with a click on[http://prairiedevcon.com/Schedule](http://prairiedevcon.com/Schedule).
