I'm talking today on next generation JavaScript which is really a misnomer. This is more like different approaches to JavaScript. The talk covers TypeScript, CoffeeScript and Dart. I have some demo code which is available and is up on [github](https://github.com/stimms/NextGenJavaScript). The slides are pretty minimalist but if you really want them then drop me a line and you can have them.The topic of the presentation as I sent it to the conference organizer is
