Have you guys heard about this Azure thing but not sure what it is? Did your boss read an article about "The Cloud"¬ù in a 3 years old copy of CIO Magazine he found while waiting for Tip Top Tailors to fashion a suit of sufficient size to contain his gigantic, non-technical girth? Know all about Azure but haven't had a chance yet to try it out?
